## 6. Game Rules
The game has 2 players, playing in rounds <br>
In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wants. Each result get added to his ROUND score.<br>
BUT, if the player rolls a 1 (in either of the dice), all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, It's the next player's turn.<br>
The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, It's the next player's turn<br>
The first player to reach 100 points or more on GLOBAL score wins the game.
